# Workflows

## How to Decide Which Workflow

```
Does code exist?
│
├── NO → Do you know what to build?
│        ├── YES → W1 Build (ideate → architect → design → scaffold)
│        └── NO  → W5 Explore (ideate → then W1/W3/W4)
│
└── YES → What's the goal?
          │
          ├── Something's wrong but I'm not sure what
          │   → W0 Triage (review-arch + code-review → read findings → choose W2/W3/W4)
          │
          ├── Structure is painful, needs cleanup
          │   → W2 Refactor (review-arch + code-review → refactoring-plan → refactor)
          │
          ├── Adding a feature to well-structured code
          │   → W4 Extend (review-arch [recommended] → architect → design → scaffold)
          │
          ├── Fundamental redesign needed
          │   → W3 Redesign (W2 + architect/design before refactoring)
          │
          └── Complete rewrite
              → W6 Rewrite — GATE: "Are you being honest or just impatient?"
                If impatient → W2 Refactor.
                If honest → W1 Build with data migration plan.
```

| Workflow | Name | When |
|---|---|---|
| W0 | Triage | Something's wrong but not sure what — need diagnostics first |
| W1 | Build New | Greenfield project from scratch |
| W2 | Refactor | Code works, structure is messy |
| W3 | Redesign | Boundaries are wrong, code has value |
| W4 | Extend | Add capability to existing system |
| W5 | Explore | Vague problem, need to think before committing |
| W6 | Rewrite | Beyond saving (are you sure?) |

---

## W0: Triage — "Something's wrong but I don't know what"

**When:** User says the code is broken, slow, flaky, confusing, or "needs work" but
hasn't diagnosed whether it's a structural problem, a code quality problem, or both.

**Skill chain:** `review-architecture + code-review → findings → user chooses next workflow`

**Steps:**

1. Run review-architecture on the codebase (produces scored diagnostic + findings)
2. Run code-review on the codebase (produces severity-ranked findings)
3. Present combined findings to the user
4. **ROUTING GATE:** Based on findings, recommend a workflow:

| Findings show | Recommend | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Structural problems (boundary violations, dependency cycles, god modules) but code quality is acceptable | W2 Refactor | Structure needs fixing, code is fine |
| Code quality problems (bugs, style, DRY) but structure is sound | W2 Refactor (lightweight — may only need code-level fixes) | Structure is fine, fix the code |
| Both structural and code quality problems | W2 Refactor (full) | Fix both |
| Structure is fundamentally wrong for the use case | W3 Redesign | Need to rethink boundaries before fixing |
| Structure is sound, user actually wants to add something | W4 Extend | Triage revealed the codebase is fine — proceed to feature work |

Present the recommendation with rationale. The user chooses.

**Key property:** W0 produces NO plan and modifies NO code. It only produces diagnostic
artifacts (review reports) and a routing recommendation. The review Handoff sections
flow directly into whichever workflow the user picks — no work is wasted.

**Note:** W0's review outputs are the SAME artifacts that W2 starts with. If the user
picks W2 after triage, W2 skips its own review step and consumes the W0 outputs directly.
This prevents running diagnostics twice.

## W1: Build New

**When:** Starting a project from scratch. No existing code.

**Skill chain:** `ideate → architect → design → plan-tracker → scaffold → plan-tracker (verify)`

```bash
mkdir ~/Gitrepos/new-project && cd ~/Gitrepos/new-project
git init

# Step 1: Explore approaches
claude "I want to build [describe the problem]. Help me ideate —
       what are my options and what are the trade-offs?"
# → Decision Summary with chosen approach
# → CHECKPOINT: you pick an approach

# Step 2: Decompose into components
claude "architect this — what should the components be,
       where do the boundaries go?"
# → Domain model, module decomposition, abstraction decisions
# → CHECKPOINT: you approve the decomposition

# Step 3: Wire it together
claude "design the architecture — dependency graph, interfaces,
       data flow, file structure"
# → Dependency graph, protocols, file tree, error handling strategy
# → CHECKPOINT: you approve the design

# Step 4: Create plan and scaffold
claude "create a tracked plan and scaffold the project"
# → PLAN-*.md created with scaffolding steps + pre-execution snapshot
# → Project files created following your conventions
# → Plan updated as each file is created
# → You fill in the domain logic

# Step 5: Verify
claude "verify the plan"
# → Confirms all scaffolding steps completed
# → Lists files created, test fixtures in place
```

**Exit state:** Scaffolded project with protocols, config, CLI entry point, test fixtures, and TODO markers where domain logic goes.

---

## W2: Refactor

**When:** Code works but the structure is painful. The components are right, the organisation is wrong.

**Indicators:** Architecture review scorecard mostly 🟢/🟡 with a few 🟠. You're not questioning *what* the pieces are, just *how* they're arranged.

**Skill chain:** `review-architecture → code-review → refactoring-plan → plan-tracker → refactor → plan-tracker (verify)`

```bash
cd ~/Gitrepos/existing-project

# Step 1: Diagnose system-level structure
claude "review the architecture of this project"
# → Scored diagnostic: 7 dimensions, dependency graph, findings
# → architecture-review.md produced

# Step 2: Diagnose file-level code quality
claude "review the code in src/"
# → Severity-ranked findings with BEFORE/AFTER snippets
# → code-review.md produced

# Step 3: Prioritise and plan
claude "create a refactoring plan from the review findings"
# → Consolidated findings, dependency DAG, Pareto analysis
# → Phased roadmap produced
# → PLAN-*.md created with all steps PENDING + pre-execution snapshot
# → CHECKPOINT: you approve the plan

# Step 4: Execute phase by phase
claude "execute Phase 1 of the refactoring plan"
# → Changes made, tests pass after each step
# → PLAN-*.md updated: steps move PENDING → DONE/FAILED
# → On failure: Claude stops and asks retry/skip/abort
# → Repeat for each phase

# Step 5: Verify
claude "verify the plan"
# → Completion check (all steps DONE or SKIPPED?)
# → Diff summary (files, lines, tests before vs after)
# → Architecture re-review with before/after scorecard
# → Verdict appended to PLAN-*.md
```

**Rules:**
- External behaviour never changes during refactoring
- Tests pass after every single step — if they don't, the step is wrong
- Never refactor and add features simultaneously
- If during refactoring you discover the decomposition itself is wrong → switch to W3

**Exit state:** Same functionality, better structure, improved scorecard.

---

## W3: Redesign

**When:** The module boundaries are in the wrong places. The core abstraction doesn't fit anymore. Individual code is fine but the architecture isn't.

**Indicators:** Architecture review scorecard has 🟠 or 🔴 on Boundary Quality, Dependency Direction, or Extensibility. Adding a new capability requires touching 5+ files (shotgun surgery). The pain is structural, not cosmetic.

**Skill chain:** `review-architecture → architect → design → refactoring-plan → plan-tracker → refactor → plan-tracker (verify)`

```bash
cd ~/Gitrepos/existing-project

# Step 1: Understand what exists and what's broken
claude "review the architecture of this project"
# → Scorecard identifies structural problems
# → architecture-review.md produced

# Step 2: Re-decompose — what SHOULD the components be?
claude "the architecture review found [summarise key findings].
       Re-architect this project — what should the components be,
       where should the boundaries go?"
# → New domain model, new boundary decisions, new abstractions
# → Side-by-side: current decomposition vs proposed decomposition
# → CHECKPOINT: you approve the new decomposition

# Step 3: Design the target state
claude "design the new architecture for the approved decomposition"
# → New dependency graph, new interfaces, new file structure
# → This is the TARGET — what the project looks like when done
# → CHECKPOINT: you approve the target design

# Step 4: Plan the migration
claude "create a refactoring plan to migrate from the current
       architecture to the new design"
# → Ordered steps from current state to target state
# → Each step leaves the system working — no big bang
# → PLAN-*.md created with all steps PENDING + pre-execution snapshot
# → CHECKPOINT: you approve the migration plan

# Step 5: Execute phase by phase
claude "execute Phase 1 of the migration plan"
# → Incremental structural changes, tests pass at each step
# → PLAN-*.md updated as steps complete
# → On failure: Claude stops and asks retry/skip/abort
# → Repeat for each phase

# Step 6: Verify
claude "verify the plan"
# → Completion check, diff summary, architecture re-review
# → Before/after scorecard confirms structural improvement
# → Verdict appended to PLAN-*.md
```

**Rules:**
- Migration is incremental. No "delete everything and start over" steps.
- Every intermediate state is a working system with passing tests.
- If a migration step can't be done safely, break it into smaller steps.
- The plan may include writing adapter code that bridges old and new structures temporarily — this is expected and gets cleaned up in later phases.

**How it differs from W2 (Refactor):**
- W2 keeps the existing module boundaries and cleans up within them
- W3 moves the boundaries themselves — modules get split, merged, renamed, or replaced
- W3 has an architect + design phase that W2 doesn't need
- W3 is harder and riskier, which is why the migration plan is critical

**Exit state:** Same functionality, fundamentally better architecture, new scorecard.

---

## W4: Extend

**When:** Adding a new capability (new strategy, new data source, new CLI command, new pipeline stage) to an existing system.

**Skill chain:** `review-architecture [recommended] → architect → design → plan-tracker → scaffold → plan-tracker (verify)`

### Step 0 (Recommended): Review existing architecture

Before designing the extension, run review-architecture on the existing codebase.
This catches stale assumptions about boundaries.

**GATE:** "I've reviewed the existing architecture. [Summary of current boundaries].
Do you want to proceed to architect with this context, or skip the review?"

- If the user skips: proceed to architect with direct entry (no upstream Handoff)
- If the user proceeds: architect receives the review-architecture Handoff and uses
  the findings to inform where the new feature fits

**Why this matters:** Extending without reviewing means designing against your mental
model of the boundaries, not the actual boundaries. If the model is wrong, you get
shotgun surgery — the new feature touches 5 files instead of 1.

```bash
cd ~/Gitrepos/existing-project

# Step 0 (recommended): Review architecture — see above
claude "review the architecture of this project"
# → GATE: proceed with context, or skip?

# Step 1: Where does the new capability fit?
claude "I want to add [describe capability] to this project.
       Architect where it fits — new module? extends existing?
       where do the boundaries go?"
# → Analysis of existing structure
# → Where new code lives, what it depends on, what depends on it
# → Whether existing boundaries need adjustment
# → CHECKPOINT: you approve the placement

# Step 2: Design the integration
claude "design the integration — interfaces, data flow, how it
       wires into the existing system"
# → New/modified protocols, config changes, test strategy
# → CHECKPOINT: you approve the design

# Step 3: Create plan and scaffold
claude "create a tracked plan and scaffold the new [strategy/pipeline/module]"
# → PLAN-*.md created with scaffolding + integration steps
# → Files created following existing project conventions
# → Wired into existing CLI, config, and test structure
# → TODO markers where domain logic goes

# Step 4: Verify
claude "verify the plan"
# → Confirms all steps completed, files created, integration wired
```

**Rules:**
- Read existing code before proposing new structure. Match conventions.
- New module should be testable in isolation before integrating.
- If adding the capability reveals that existing boundaries are wrong → note it, finish the extension, then run W3 to fix the structure.

**Exit state:** New capability integrated, following existing patterns, with tests.

---

## W5: Explore

**When:** You have a vague problem or idea. You're not ready to build, redesign, or refactor. You need to think.

**Skill chain:** `ideate` (may lead to W1, W3, or W4 depending on outcome)

```bash
# Can be run from anywhere — not repo-specific
claude "I'm thinking about [describe the problem/idea].
       Help me explore the options and stress-test my thinking."
# → Mode A (open): 2-3 structurally different approaches with trade-offs
# → Mode B (stress-test): assumption audit, inversion, second-order consequences
# → Decision Summary

# Then based on outcome:
# "Build it new"       → W1
# "Redesign existing"  → W3
# "Extend existing"    → W4
# "Need more info"     → stay in W5, iterate
```

**Exit state:** Decision Summary with chosen approach, key trade-offs, and load-bearing assumptions. Ready to enter W1, W3, or W4.

---

## W6: Rewrite (rare)

**When:** The existing code's architecture is so tangled that every refactoring step would break something else. The cost of migration exceeds the cost of starting fresh.

**Bar is very high.** Most code that feels 🔴 is actually W3 (redesign). Before choosing W6, ask: "Am I being honest or just impatient?"

**Skill chain:** `review-architecture (old) → ideate → W1 (new project)`

```bash
# Step 1: Learn from the old code — don't just abandon it
cd ~/Gitrepos/old-project
claude "review the architecture of this project. Focus on:
       what works well, what's fundamentally broken, and what
       domain logic should be preserved in a rewrite."
# → Review becomes a LESSONS LEARNED document
# → Identifies salvageable domain logic (algorithms, formulas, rules)

# Step 2: Start fresh with the lessons
mkdir ~/Gitrepos/new-project && cd ~/Gitrepos/new-project
git init

claude "I'm rewriting old-project from scratch. Here's what the
       review found: [paste key findings]. Ideate the right
       approach for the new version."
# → Then follow W1: architect → design → scaffold
```

**Rules:**
- Do NOT copy-paste old code into new structure. Re-implement from the new design.
- Reference old code only for domain logic that was correct (algorithms, formulas, business rules).
- The new project should pass the architecture review with 🟢 across all dimensions from day one.

**Exit state:** New project with sound architecture, informed by lessons from the old one.

## Multi-Repo Workflow

When reviewing and improving multiple repos:

```bash
# Review all repos first — diagnose before treating
for repo in orch dynamic-melo credit-analytics; do
    cd ~/Gitrepos/$repo
    claude "review the architecture of this project"
done

# Compare scorecards across repos
# Prioritise: which repo's structural debt is blocking you most?
# Execute the appropriate workflow (W2/W3/W4) per repo
```

## Workflow Decision Cheat Sheet

| Situation | Workflow | First command |
|---|---|---|
| "Something's wrong but I'm not sure what" | W0 Triage | `claude "review the architecture..."` then `claude "review the code..."` |
| "I want to build something new" | W1 Build | `claude "ideate..."` |
| "This code works but it's messy" | W2 Refactor | `claude "review the architecture..."` |
| "The structure is fundamentally wrong" | W3 Redesign | `claude "review the architecture..."` |
| "I want to add a new feature" | W4 Extend | `claude "review the architecture..."` then `claude "architect where [X] fits..."` |
| "I have a vague idea" | W5 Explore | `claude "ideate..."` |
| "This is beyond saving" | W6 Rewrite | `claude "review the architecture..."` (lessons learned) then W1 |

## Common Transitions

Workflows aren't always linear. Common mid-workflow transitions:

| During | You discover | Switch to |
|---|---|---|
| W0 Triage | Structure is sound, user wants to add something | W4 Extend |
| W0 Triage | Structural or code quality problems found | W2 Refactor |
| W0 Triage | Boundaries fundamentally wrong | W3 Redesign |
| W2 Refactor | Boundaries are wrong, not just messy | W3 Redesign |
| W3 Redesign | A specific module needs extending too | Finish W3, then W4 |
| W4 Extend | Existing structure can't accommodate the feature | W3 Redesign first, then W4 |
| W5 Explore | The problem maps to an existing repo | W4 Extend or W3 Redesign |
| W5 Explore | The problem is genuinely new | W1 Build |
| Any | Review scorecard is worse than expected | Step back, re-evaluate scope |
